# Aries
Aries is my attempt to build a personal AI assistant that feels alive—voice-driven, emotionally aware, and with infinite memory. It’s not just automation; it’s a conversational companion that recalls context, adapts, and evolves like human, built using Python, local models, and real-time voice.
